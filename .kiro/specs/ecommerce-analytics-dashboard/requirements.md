# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create a comprehensive end-to-end e-commerce data analysis portfolio project that demonstrates real-world data analysis skills to potential employers. The project will showcase the complete data science pipeline from data collection through deployment, focusing on answering specific business questions that provide actionable value to e-commerce stakeholders. The final deliverable will be a deployed Streamlit dashboard with a modern dark theme that presents insights in a business-friendly format, hosted on GitHub for version control and professional presentation.
